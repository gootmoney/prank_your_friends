Here's the prank in a nutshell:
The BAT file
Locates where it is.
Runs the PowerShell script with "bypass" so it will run every time.
The PowerShell script
Changes all text to green.
Presents a fake Windows banner and waits for you to type /e.
Traverses all folders in C:\\\Windows\\\System32 (but doesn't open them).
Enters into an infinite loop where it:
Prints "Deleting: <folder path>" lightning fast for every folder.
Then prints "[âœ“] Directories loaded. Streaming random paths." and outputs random paths continuously. Result in It merely prints green "Deleting." messages on screen. Nothing on your computer is being deleted.
